# a summary about you
summary: |
  I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Arizona, 
  where I work with [Dr. Jason Pacheco](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~pachecoj/)
  in the Stochastic Systems and Learning Group. 
  My work blends math, machine learning and a healthy respect for uncertainty. 

  Before Arizona, I earned a Master's in Mathematics at Brigham Young University, 
  where I worked with [Dr. Jared Whitehead](https://tsunami.byu.edu/jared-p-whitehead) on the [TsunamiBayes project](https://tsunami.byu.edu/whitehead-lab)
  developing Bayesian tools for analyzing tsunamis from historical records.

  I study how to make good decisions under uncertainty:
  How to ask the right questions, gather the right data, and take the right actions.
  My research focuses on Bayesian optimal experimental design,
  information-theoretic goals, and inference via MCMC, with applications
  in geophysics and political science.

  Outside of research, you'll find me in the mountains, backpacking or skiing,
  making music, or off-grid with my family.
